// Electrocution Shot Check
/*
This allows the effect of shooting randomly when getting shocked.

This inventory must be checked for in a weapon's routine for it to work on
that weapon, otherwise it will be ignored. Additionally, all weapons should
have a line in their Select: state to remove this when sweapping weapons,
so if there is a stray one left over, it won't randomly shoot a gun that
does apply the effect.

// Cough Check
/*
This allows the effect of pitching downward and back up in coughing.

This inventory must be checked for in a weapon's routine for it to work on
that weapon, otherwise it will be ignored. Additionally, all weapons should
have a line in their Select: state to remove this when sweapping weapons,

Weapon Swap Wait

When the Ready: state reads that this inventory is present,
it will force the weapon to go to the Deselect: state, so
taking up the new weapon will first fully flush the previous
weapon's content.
